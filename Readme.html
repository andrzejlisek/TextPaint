<h1>Overview</h1>

<p><strong>TextPaint</strong> is not designed to use as plain
text editor, there is designed to create or modify text as a
simple graphic or scheme using ANSI or Unicode characters. You
can create texts such as organizational charts, simple circuit
schemes, algorithm flow, tables, to use it where destination
medium supports text printed using fixed-width font.</p>

<p>The text can be both monochrome saved as plain text or color
saved as text with ANSI escape commands. You can view or edit
many existing ASCII-art or ANSI-art files.</p>

<p>This application works in system console, but it can also work
as graphical window, which simulates the console. You can resize
the console or window, but application will be repainted after
pressing any key. Application will not be repainted after
resizing while the character selector is shown, but the
application will be repainted after closing the character table
and pressing any key.</p>

<p><strong>TextPaint</strong> also provides simple cipher, which
user Vigenere algorithm. You can encipher some text fragments
using password.</p>

<h2>Other functions</h2>

<p><strong>TextPaint</strong> has other function than text
editor, called as work modes. Other work modes uses the same ANSI
interpreter and was implemented to test various cases.</p>

<p>There are available following work modes, choosen by <strong>WorkMode</strong>
parameter:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>WorkMode=0</strong> - Text editor, the main
        purpose of <strong>TestPaint</strong>, which is described
        in <strong>Readme.md</strong> file.</li>
    <li><strong>WorkMode=1</strong> - ANSI viewer with
        progressive printing and server. This mode can be used to
        view animation created by progressive placing characters
        and is described in <strong>Readme_ANSI.md</strong> file.</li>
    <li><strong>WorkMode=2</strong> - Telnet or SSH client, which
        is parially compatible with VT100, ANSI and derivative
        terminal emulators. Details about this mode are described
        in <strong>Readme_ANSI.md</strong> file.</li>
    <li><strong>WorkMode=3</strong> - Encoding list display and
        keycode test. The only purpose is displaying supported
        encoding list and code/name of every pressed key, which
        is needed to implement additional functions and test the <strong>TextPaint</strong>
        in various platforms. This mode is described in <strong>Readme_keys.md</strong>
        file.</li>
    <li><strong>WorkMode=4</strong> - Non-interactive simple
        command line application, without any interface:<ul>
            <li>Render text into bitmap image detailed in <strong>Readme_render.md</strong>
                file.</li>
            <li>Convert XBIN or BIN file to ANSI text file.</li>
            <li>Save to files all available 1-byte encodings.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Two editions</h2>

<p>TextPaint exists in two editions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>.NET Framework - compatible with .NET 4.5, uses Windows
        Forms as graphical user interface.</li>
    <li>.NET Core - compatible with .NET 6.0, uses Avalonia as
        graphical user interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both editions have identical functionality, but can have some
subtle differences like following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Available .NET built-in text encodings.</li>
    <li>Bell sound availability.</li>
    <li>Interaction with system clipboard.</li>
    <li>Fullscreen window display.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Application running</h1>

<p>For the .NET Framework edition, input file name as command
line parameter. If you not give parameter or give blank file
name, the <strong>Config.txt</strong> file will be opened to
allow editing the configuration file.</p>

<pre>TextPaint.exe FileNameWithPath.txt [parameters]</pre>

<p>If you use <strong>Mono</strong> project (required in Linux),
you can run application with this command:</p>

<pre>mono TextPaint.exe FileNameWithPath.txt [parameters]</pre>

<p>The .NET Core edition can be run on Windows and Linux by the
command:</p>

<pre>dotnet TextPaint.dll FileNameWithPath.txt [parameters]</pre>

<p>In the further document text, there will be uset the <font
face="Liberation Serif"><tt>TextPaint</tt></font> as application
file name.</p>

<p>You can also override configuration options, which can be used
in <strong>Config.txt</strong> file. From second parameter,
application accepts configuration parameters profided with <strong>=</strong>
character. For example, to force running in 40x15 window, run
this command:</p>

<pre>TextPaint FileNameWithPath.txt WinUse=2 WinW=40 WinH=15</pre>

<p>In work mode 3, in place of file name, you have to provide
server address with port. if the port equals to 23, it can be
ommited.</p>

<pre>TextPaint 192.168.1.100:23 WorkMode=3</pre>

<p>All options are described in <strong>Configuration file</strong>
chapter.</p>

<h2>Application files and directories</h2>

<p><strong>TextPaint</strong> is supplied with the following
files and directories:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Samples</strong> - Sample text files.</li>
    <li><strong>Fonts</strong> - Bitmap fonts.</li>
    <li><strong>Config.txt</strong> - Main configuration file.</li>
    <li><strong>Fav.txt</strong> - Favorite character
        definitions.</li>
    <li><strong>Info.txt</strong> - Context information.</li>
    <li><strong>TextPaint.exe</strong> or <strong>TextPaint.dll</strong>
        - Application binary executable.</li>
    <li>Libraries needed to run the <strong>TextPaint</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Functionality and interface</h1>

<p><img src="1_01.gif" alt="`Readme/1_01.png" width="640"
height="384"></p>

<p>TextPaint can work in one of the 4 states. The default state
is <strong>state 1</strong>. In all states, you can use these
keys:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Arrows</strong> - Move cursor horizontally or
        vertically.</li>
    <li><strong>Home, End, PageUp</strong>, <strong>PageDown</strong>
        - Move cursor diagonally.</li>
    <li><strong>Tab</strong> - Change cursor visualization type,
        one of four modes. This function may help to match
        writing/drawing to other objects.</li>
    <li><strong>F1</strong> - Switch to <strong>state 1</strong>
        (edit text) or show information about <strong>state 1</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>F2</strong> - Switch to <strong>state 2</strong>
        (edit characters) or show information about <strong>state
        2</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>F3</strong> - Switch to <strong>state 3</strong>
        (character paint) or show information about <strong>state
        3</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>F4</strong> - Switch to <strong>state 4</strong>
        (pixel paint) or show information about <strong>state 4</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>F7</strong> - Save file. If the cipher is
        enabled, you will have to input cipher password twice. If
        password is not the same, you will have to input password
        one more time.</li>
    <li><strong>F8</strong> - Reload file. If the cipher is
        enabled, you will have to input cipher password used to
        save the file.</li>
    <li><strong>F9</strong> - Open character selection to draw.</li>
    <li><strong>F12</strong> - Quit TextPaint.</li>
    <li><strong>Z</strong> - Undo (not works in <strong>state 1</strong>
        and <strong>state 2</strong>).</li>
    <li><strong>X</strong> - Redo (not works in <strong>state 1</strong>
        and <strong>state 2</strong>).</li>
</ul>

<p>To undo or redo editing text or characters (<strong>state 1</strong>
or <strong>state 2</strong>), you can undo/redy by following
procedure:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Switch temporarily to <strong>state 2</strong> or <strong>state
        3</strong>.</li>
    <li>Press <strong>Z</strong> or <strong>X</strong> key to
        undo or redo.</li>
    <li>Switch back to <strong>state 0</strong> or <strong>state
        1</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The other available keys depends on the current working state.
The unnecessary spaces and lines are automatically trimmed during
editing. You can write on the grey aread, then necessary lines or
spaces will be added automatically.</p>

<p>The colors are following:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>White text on black background</strong> - Actual
        text.</li>
    <li><strong>Dark gray</strong> - Space beyond end of line.</li>
    <li><strong>Bright gray</strong> - Space below the last line.</li>
    <li><strong>Black text in white background</strong> - Status
        bar.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Context information</h2>

<p>When you press the <strong>F1</strong>, <strong>F2</strong>, <strong>F3</strong>,
<strong>F4</strong> key one more time, after switchint to the
state, there will be displayed short information about selected
state. Use arrow keys to scroll the text.</p>

        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>The status bar in <strong>state 4</strong> has different
layout, which is described in subchapter about <strong>state 4</strong>.</p>

<h1>Character and color selector</h1>

<p><strong>TextPaint</strong> has two similar selectors. In order
to enter into selector, press <strong>F9</strong> key and switch
between selectors by pressing <strong>F3</strong> key.</p>

<h2>Character selector</h2>

<p>In the <strong>state 3</strong> and <strong>state 4</strong>,
you can draw using selected character. The current drawing
character and character code is shown on the status bar when the
character is used to draw. In the <strong>state 1</strong>, <strong>state
2</strong> and <strong>state 3</strong>, if you insert space (in
mode <strong>H-block</strong> and <strong>V-block</strong> only),
the selected character will be inserted. You can invoke the
character selector in every state by pressing the <strong>F9</strong>
key.</p>

<p><img src="1_04.gif" alt="`Readme/1_04.png" width="640"
height="384"></p>

<p>At the top of character table there will be display the
character hexadecimal code and character glyph. The code consists
of 4 or 5 digits. The plane 16 forces code length to be 6 digits,
but is used very rarely, so the leading <strong>10</strong>
digits for plane 16 is replaced by <strong>G</strong> to get
5-digital code. The <strong>G</strong> digit is outside of
hexadecimal digit set and means 16. For example, the <strong>G1234</strong>
has the same meaning as <strong>101234</strong>.</p>

<p>The character selector can work in two states:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Ordinary</strong> - Browse all characters. By
        default, browsing the pages is limited, but the limit can
        be enabled and disabled by pressing <strong>F4</strong>
        key. The limit depends on work conditions:<ul>
            <li>When window is used (<strong>WinUse=1</strong> or
                <strong>WinUse=2</strong>) and there is used
                bitmap font: The pages, which are drawn in font
                graphics file.</li>
            <li>Otherwise: The pages with characters outside of
                range from <strong>D800</strong> to <strong>DF00</strong>.
                The characters within this range are not regular
                characters and can not be rendered in most cases.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Favorite</strong> - The 256 places of favorite
        characters, 95 of them can be assigned to alphanumeric
        keys.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use the following keys while the character table is
shown:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Arrows</strong> - Select character on the current
        page. You can go beyond the current page range to switch
        the page.</li>
    <li><strong>Page up</strong>, <strong>Page down</strong> -
        Flip one page up or down (go ahead 256 characters).</li>
    <li><strong>Home</strong>, <strong>End</strong> - Flip 16
        pages up or down (go ahead 4096 characters).</li>
    <li><strong>F1</strong>, <strong>F2</strong> - Switch the
        plane (go ahead 65536 characters).</li>
    <li><strong>F3</strong> - Switch to <strong>color selector</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>F4</strong> - Browsing all pages, including
        invisible (character selector state). This function
        allows to browse through all pages even, when you loaded
        bitmap font and the font does not include characters for
        all pages.</li>
    <li><strong>Insert</strong> - Switch between ordinary and
        favorite state:<ul>
            <li><strong>Ordinary</strong>: If the pinted
                character exists in favorite set, there will be
                pointed.</li>
            <li><strong>Favorite</strong>: There will be pointed
                the same character, which is pointed in favorite
                state.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong> - Go to character being under the
        cursor.</li>
    <li><strong>Backspace</strong>:<ul>
            <li><strong>Ordinary</strong>: Select character for
                save as favorite.</li>
            <li><strong>Favorite</strong>: Select character or
                put character on pointed place.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Tab</strong> - Move character selector window
        from corner to corner. You can use this if the window
        covers some text or window is bigger than screen.</li>
    <li><strong>Esc</strong> - Close without changing selected
        character.</li>
    <li><strong>Enter</strong> - Change selected character and
        close.</li>
    <li><strong>Any alphanumeric key</strong>:<ul>
            <li><strong>Ordinary</strong>: Save pointed character
                as favorite under pressed key.</li>
            <li><strong>Favorite</strong>: Go to place assigned
                with pressed key.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Color selector</h2>

<p>You can turn character selector into color selector or turn
color selector into character chelector by pressing <strong>F3</strong>.
In color selector, you can select the color and input text mode.
The text and colors are treated as two independed layers, which
can be modifed simultaneously or separately.</p>

<p><img src="1_05.gif" alt="`Readme/1_05.png" width="640"
height="384"></p>

<p>While the color selector is showm, you can use the following
keys:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Up arrow</strong>, <strong>Down arrow</strong> -
        Select background color.</li>
    <li><strong>Left arrow</strong>, <strong>Right arrow</strong>
        - Select foreground color.</li>
    <li><strong>Page up</strong>, <strong>Page down</strong> -
        Number of columns for ANSI file load. Use if file is
        loaded incorrectly, applicable when <strong>ANSIRead=1</strong>.
        Value 0 means unlimited.</li>
    <li><strong>Home</strong>, <strong>End</strong> - Number of
        rows for ANSI file load. Use if file is loaded
        incorrectly, applicable when <strong>ANSIRead=1</strong>.
        Value 0 means unlimited.</li>
    <li><strong>F1</strong> - Switch between CR character
        processing while loading file, when when <strong>ANSIRead=1</strong>:<ul>
            <li><strong>0</strong> - Treat as CR character
                (default).</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> - Treat as CR+LF sequence.</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> - Ignore CR character.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>F2</strong> - Switch between LF character
        processing while loading file, when when <strong>ANSIRead=1</strong>:<ul>
            <li><strong>0</strong> - Treat as LF character
                (default).</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> - Treat as CR+LF sequence.</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> - Ignore LF character.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>F3</strong> - Switch to <strong>character
        selector</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Insert</strong> - Switch between edit mode within
        three states:<ul>
            <li><strong>Text + color</strong> - Edit text and
                color simultaneously.</li>
            <li><strong>Text</strong> - Edit text only without
                color changing.</li>
            <li><strong>Color</strong> - Edit color only without
                text changing.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong> - Go to color being under the
        cursor.</li>
    <li><strong>Tab</strong> - Move color selector window from
        corner to corner. You can use this if the window covers
        some text or window is bigger than screen.</li>
    <li><strong>Esc</strong> - Close without changing selected
        color.</li>
    <li><strong>Enter</strong> - Change selected color and close.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can change text without changing colors or colors without
changing the text. In order to do, switch to appropriate mode
using <strong>Insert</strong> key. The text and colors are
independed layes.</p>

<h2>ANSI file loading</h2>

<p>Many ANSI files are prepared for specified number of columns,
in most cases for 80 columns and unlimited number of rows. If you
set other number of columns or use unlimited number of columns (<strong>ANSIWidth=0</strong>),
the file may be loaded incorrectly. To correct this, enter into
color selector, change number of columns or rows using <strong>Page
up</strong>, <strong>Page down</strong>, <strong>Home</strong> or
<strong>End</strong> keys and press <strong>Enter</strong> key.
Then, you have to reload file using <strong>F8</strong> keys.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the number of rows can also be specified for
particular file and the file can be loaded incorrectly, when
number of rows are unlimited. The most popular numbers of rows in
such case are <strong>24</strong> and <strong>25</strong>.</p>

<p>If there file loaded with <strong>ANSIRead=1</strong> is
actually plain text file, the file can contain different
end-of-line character. If the file is loaded incorrectly, you can
change parsing of CR (<strong>0Dh</strong>) and LF (<strong>0Ah</strong>)
character in color selector. You can press <strong>F1</strong> or
<strong>F2</strong> during color selector to change way of the
character processing, the current state is diaplayed as two
digits on the top of character selector. Example settings:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>00</strong> - Standard process of CR and LF
        characters, suitable for all ANSI files and text files
        using CR+LF like files created in DOS and Windows.</li>
    <li><strong>21</strong> - Use LF character as CR+LF (EOL),
        suitable for plain text files created on Unix and Linux,
        which uses LF as EOL.</li>
    <li><strong>12</strong> - Use CR character as CR+LF (EOL),
        suitable for plain text files created on systems, which
        uses CR as EOL.</li>
    <li><strong>11</strong> - Use every CR character and every LF
        character as EOL separately.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Work states</h1>

<p><strong>TextPaint</strong> in work mode 0 works in one of 4
states, which you can swich by pressing <strong>F1</strong>, <strong>F2</strong>,
<strong>F3</strong>, or <strong>F4</strong> key. In order to
display help text about keys available in the current state,
press the same function key again. For example, in order to get
help about state 2, press <strong>F2</strong> while
applicationworks in state 2.</p>

<h2>State 1 - Write text</h2>

<p>In the <strong>state 1</strong>, you can input alphanumeric
characters like in every standard text editor, but there are few
differences.</p>

<p>You can use the following functional keys:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Esc</strong> - Change writing direction.</li>
    <li><strong>Backspace</strong> - Move cursor in opposite
        direction (this not delete the char).</li>
    <li><strong>Insert</strong> - Insert line or character.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong> - Delete line or character.</li>
    <li><strong>Enter</strong> - Change Insert/Delete mode.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Undo and redo</h3>

<p>You can undo or redo writing, but the direct function not
exists. To undo or redo, you have to switch to <strong>state 3</strong>
or <strong>state 4</strong> by pressing <strong>F3</strong> or <strong>F4</strong>.
Then, you can undo or redo by pressing <strong>Z</strong> or <strong>X</strong>.
After undo or redo, you can return to <strong>state 1</strong> by
pressing <strong>F1</strong>.</p>

<h3>Insert and delete</h3>

<p>The <strong>Enter</strong>, <strong>Insert</strong> and <strong>Delete</strong>
keys has different function than standard text editor.</p>

<p>By pressing <strong>Enter</strong>, you can choose between
four insert/delete modes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>H-block</strong> - Insert or delete text inside
        one line, at right from the cursor - moves text
        horizontally.</li>
    <li><strong>V-block</strong> - Insert or delete text inside
        one column, below the cursor - moves text vertically.</li>
    <li><strong>H-line</strong> - Insert or delete columns -
        moves text horizontally.</li>
    <li><strong>V-line</strong> - Insert or delete rows - moves
        text vertically.</li>
    <li><strong>H-roll</strong> - Roll the text horizontally -
        combine of insertion and deletion by font width, works on
        the <strong>state 3</strong> only and when the rectangle
        width is greater than 1.</li>
    <li><strong>V-roll</strong> - Roll the text vertically -
        combine of insertion and deletion by font height, works
        on the <strong>state 3</strong> only and when the
        rectangle height is greater than 1.</li>
</ul>

<h2>State 2 - Write characters</h2>

<p><strong>State 2</strong> works exactly by the same way as <strong>state
1</strong> with one difference: If you press alphanumeric key,
there will be written favorite characters assignet to the keys
instead of ordinary characters. You can view and change the
assigment in character selector.</p>

<p><img src="1_10.gif" alt="`Readme/1_10.png" width="640"
height="384"></p>

<p>The state is most usable when you frequently write specified
characters, because you can write the character just by pressing
assigned key.</p>

<h2>State 3 - Character drawing</h2>

<p><strong>State 3</strong> is intended to the following actions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Draw line using frame characters.</li>
    <li>Undo and redo.</li>
    <li>Draw the rectangle or diamond on the selected place
        without painting line manually.</li>
    <li>Copy and paste text.</li>
    <li>Manually write frame elements.</li>
    <li>Insert or delete larger portion of spaces.</li>
    <li>Change font size.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="1_06.gif" alt="`Readme/1_06.png" width="640"
height="384"></p>

<p>In the <strong>state 3</strong>, you have the following
functions available:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>W</strong>,<strong>S</strong>,<strong>A</strong>,<strong>D</strong>
        - Change figure size.</li>
    <li><strong>Q</strong>,<strong>E</strong> - Change cursor
        position within the rectangle or diamond.<ul>
            <li><strong>Q</strong> - Move counter clockwise.</li>
            <li><strong>E</strong> - Move clockwise.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>1</strong> - Change figure shape one of 9.</li>
    <li><strong>2</strong> - Change character set.</li>
    <li><strong>3</strong> - Draw hollow frame.</li>
    <li><strong>4</strong> - Draw filled frame.</li>
    <li><strong>5</strong> - Start or stop drawing line by moving
        cursor.</li>
    <li><strong>6,7</strong> - Font width.</li>
    <li><strong>8,9</strong> - Font height.</li>
    <li><strong>C</strong> - Copy the text being inside the
        figure.</li>
    <li><strong>V</strong> - Paste the text into the area inside
        the figure.</li>
    <li><strong>Insert</strong> - Insert line or character (works
        on rectangle shape only).</li>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong> - Delete line or character (works
        on rectangle shape only).</li>
    <li><strong>Enter</strong> - Change Insert/Delete mode.</li>
    <li><strong>I</strong> or <strong>Numpad Plus</strong> -
        Write vertical line.</li>
    <li><strong>K</strong> or <strong>Numpad Minus</strong> -
        Write horizontal line.</li>
    <li><strong>Space</strong> or <strong>Numpad 0</strong> -
        Write selected character.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Writing frame elements</h3>

<p>Apart from keys listed above, you can write frame elements
(corners, tees and crosses) using some letter keys and numpad
digits as in the following scheme:</p>

<pre>  T---Y---U         T         7---8---9         7
  |   |   |        / \        |   |   |        / \
  |   |   |       G   Y       |   |   |       4   8
  |   |   |      / \ / \      |   |   |      / \ / \
  G---H---J     B   H   U     4---5---6     1   5   9
  |   |   |      \ / \ /      |   |   |      \ / \ /
  |   |   |       N   J       |   |   |       2   6
  |   |   |        \ /        |   |   |        \ /
  B---N---M         M         1---2---3         3</pre>

<p>For example, the <strong>T</strong> key or <strong>Numpad 7</strong>
writes the upper left corner as shown above. The diamond shape is
treated as rectangle rotated clockwise.</p>

<h3>Insert and delete</h3>

<p>The insert and delete function works by the same way as in <strong>state
1</strong> and <strong>state 2</strong>, but there is few
differences:</p>

<ul>
    <li>This function works only, when rectangle shape is
        selected</li>
    <li>In <strong>H-block</strong> and <strong>H-line</strong>
        modes, the rectangle width determines number of inserted
        or deleted columns once.</li>
    <li>In <strong>V-block</strong> and <strong>V-line</strong>
        modes, the rectangle height determines number of inserted
        or deleted columns once.</li>
    <li>In <strong>H-block</strong> mode, there can be modified
        few rows according to rectangle height.</li>
    <li>In <strong>V-block</strong> mode, there can be modified
        few columns according to rectangle width.</li>
    <li>The <strong>H-roll</strong> and <strong>V-roll</strong>
        modes works in the <strong>state 3</strong> only and
        while the rectangle width (for <strong>H-roll</strong>)
        or the rectangle height (for <strong>V-roll</strong>) is
        greater then 1.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Font size</h3>

<p><strong>State 3</strong> is the only state, which allows to
change font and cursor size, which will be applied for all
states. The font width and height can be adjusted separately,
between 1 and 32 cells. The cursor size represents the current
font size and the size is indicated on the status bar. The move
step is the same as current font width or height. To move cursor
over another distance, change the font size.</p>

<p>If you change font size whice the cursor is not at the first
line and the first column, it is possible, it is possible, that
the cursor distance from begining does not equal to multiply font
width or height. In such case, when you move the cursor left or
up, the first column or the first row will not reachable, because
the remaining distance is less than font size. Cursor position
above the first row or before the first column is not possible.</p>

<p>While the font width or height is greater than 1, the current
character or color indicated on the status bar and used in some
operation is determined be the most number of cells containing
such character or color. If there are several characters in the
same number of cells within the cursor, the first occurence will
be used.</p>

<p>You can copy and paste the text preserving the font size only
when the font size is 1x1 while both copying and pasting. When
you copy or paste with other font size, the text and color will
be preserved. Otherwise, you can copy the text written with the
bigger font into the other software or paste the text from the
other software using desired font size.</p>

<h2>State 4 - Pixel drawing</h2>

<p>The <strong>state 4</strong> is purposed to draw pictures
using semigraphical characters splitted into pixels. Some
characters offers pixels by splitting for example to 2x2 pixels
per character. You can paint by character or by pixels as defined
in configuration file. In the state, there are two cursors:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Main cursor</strong> - The cursor, which is moved
        by <strong>Arrow</strong> keys and <strong>Home</strong>/<strong>End</strong>/<strong>PageUp</strong>/<strong>PageDown</strong>
        keys. Pressing these keys causes movement of both
        cursors.</li>
    <li><strong>Size cursor</strong> - The second cursor, which
        is connected with main cursor. This cursor determines
        figure size for drawing lines, rectangles, ellipses, and
        copying/pasting picture.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="1_08.gif" alt="`Readme/1_08.png" width="640"
height="384"></p>

<p>During <strong>state 4</strong>, there are following functions
by keys:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>W</strong>,<strong>S</strong>,<strong>A</strong>,<strong>D</strong>
        - Move size cursor.</li>
    <li><strong>I</strong>,<strong>K</strong>,<strong>J</strong>,<strong>L</strong>
        - Move picture between cursors.</li>
    <li><strong>1</strong> - Change paint configuration:<ul>

                character and allows to select character for
                foreground and background in character selector.</li>
            <li>The other configurations are defined in <strong>Config.txt</strong>
                file and may use several pixels per character.
                Every pixel configuration inside character is
                mapped to appropriate character.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>2</strong> - Change default color. This option
        defines, how will be treated characters other than
        characters used in current paint configuration.</li>
    <li><strong>3</strong> - Draw one pixel (in hollow mode) or
        flood fill (in fill mode).</li>
    <li><strong>4</strong> - Draw line between cursors.</li>
    <li><strong>5</strong> - Draw rectangle between cursors.</li>
    <li><strong>6</strong> - Draw ellipse between cursors.</li>
    <li><strong>P</strong> - Turn pencil on/off.</li>
    <li><strong>M</strong> - Change picture move mode. The mode
        is used while moving using <strong>I</strong>,<strong>K</strong>,<strong>J</strong>,<strong>L</strong>
        keys:<ul>
            <li><strong>Repeat</strong> - The edge of moved
                picture will be repeated.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll</strong> - The edge will be fillled

            <li><strong>Background</strong> - The edge will be
                filled with background color.</li>
            <li><strong>Foreground</strong> - The edge will be
                filled with foreground color.</li>
            <li><strong>Flip/Rotate</strong> - Flip or rotate
                instead of movement. Use keys as following:<ul>
                    <li><strong>I</strong> - Flip vertically.</li>
                    <li><strong>K</strong> - Flip horizontally.</li>
                    <li><strong>J</strong> - Rotate counter

        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Status bar</h3>

<p>In <strong>state 4</strong>, the status bar has different
layout, described from left to right:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Font and cursor size (width and height).</li>
    <li>Canvas cursor position and size in pixels. The size sign
        (plus or minus) indicates direction from main cursor to
        size cursor.</li>
    <li>The <strong>state 4</strong> indicator with default color
        and pencil state:<ul>
            <li><strong>Pxl-B</strong> - The default color is

<h3>Cursor display</h3>

<p>Console can display cursor over the character, not over the
pixel. If you select configuration with pixels smaller than
character, you will move pixel by pixel, when you press cursor
keys. The visible cursor will by over this character, which
contains pointed pixel. To point a specified pixel, you have to
observe the position on status bar or count movement from last
visible cursor movement.</p>

<p>To check position, you can draw pixel or other figure (key <strong>3</strong>,
<strong>4</strong>, <strong>5</strong>, <strong>6</strong>) and
undo the drawing by pressing <strong>Z</strong>.</p>

<h1>Configuration file</h1>

<p>In the TextPaint directory there is the <strong>Config.txt</strong>
file, which allows to configure the application. If you run
TextPaint without parameters, this file will be open. The
configuration is read in the application run moment. This file is
organized as the <strong>parameter=value</strong> convention. The
blank lines, lines without <strong>=</strong> character and
parameters other than listed below are ignored:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>WinUse</strong> - Use window instead of console.
        In certain systems and console configurations, some of
        unicode characters are not correctly rendered in the
        console. If <strong>WinUse</strong> is set to <strong>1</strong>
        or <strong>2</strong>, the TextPain will work in the
        graphical window and all unicode characters should be
        rendered correctly. The application usage is the same as
        in the console. There are allowed the following values:<ul>
            <li><strong>0</strong> - Use console, not recommended
                in cases, while there is possible to use <strong>WinUse=1</strong>
                or <strong>WinUse=2</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> - Use window with standard
                image rendering control, recommended value.</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> - Use window with non-standard
                image rendering control (only .NET Framework
                version, on .NET Core edition is the same as <strong>WinUse=1</strong>).
                Use this setting only if interface picture is not
                displayed or crashed when you use <strong>WinUse=1</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>WorkMode</strong> - Work mode of TextPaint:<ul>
            <li><strong>0</strong> - Text editor - the
                fundamental mode and purpose of <strong>TextPaint</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> - ANSI viewer and file server
                - described in <strong>Readme_ANSI.md</strong>
                file.</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> - Telnet/SSH client -
                described in <strong>Readme_ANSI.md</strong>
                file.</li>
            <li><strong>3</strong> - Encoding list and keycode
                test - described in <strong>Readme_keys.md</strong>
                file.</li>
            <li><strong>4</strong> - Render text file or ANSI
                file into image or movie - described in <strong>Readme_render.md</strong>
                file.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Bell</strong> - Bell sound type (working may
        depend on operating system and console visibility,
        regardless of <strong>WinUse</strong> value), usable in <strong>WorkMode=1</strong>
        and <strong>WorkMode=2</strong>:<ul>
            <li><strong>0</strong> - No bell.</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> - Use console beep function.</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> - Sound by writing bell
                character into console.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Space</strong> - Characters (hexadecimal
        numbers), which will be treated as space. The first
        character in the list is used as character being outside
        actual text.</li>
    <li><strong>FileReadEncoding</strong> - Encoding used in file
        reading, in most cases, it should be <strong>FileReadEncoding=utf-8</strong>.
        You can display all supported encodings using <strong>WorkMode=3</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>FileWriteEncoding</strong> - Encoding used in
        file writing, in most cases, it should be <strong>FileWriteEncoding=utf-8</strong>.
        You can display all supported encodings using <strong>WorkMode=3</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>FileReadChars</strong> - If provided greater than
        <strong>0</strong>, there is number of first characters
        (not bytes), which will be read from file, it is useful,
        when you want to create text/picture based on ANSI
        animation. The parameter works only in <strong>WorkMode=0</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Frame1_x</strong> - Character set for rectangle
        frame, the <strong>x</strong> is the number of set,
        starting from 0. The value consists of 12 items separated
        by comma.<ul>
            <li>The first item is the set name.</li>
            <li>The other items are the hexadecimal character
                codes, which are the frame elements.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Frame2_x</strong> - Character set for diamond
        frame. It works like <strong>Frame1_x</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Pixel_x</strong> - Name and pixels per character
        definition number <strong>x</strong> for <strong>state 4</strong>.
        The first must be <strong>Pixel_1</strong>. The
        parameters has three values separated by comma:<ul>
            <li>Configuration name.</li>
            <li>Horizontal pixels per character.</li>
            <li>Vertical pixels per character.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Pixel_x_y</strong> - Character list fragment for
        fumber <strong>x</strong>. For example, the first
        character list for definition number 2 is defined by
        parameter <strong>Pixel_2_1</strong>. The number of coder
        per one fragment and number of fragments are not
        important. Only the total number of character codes are
        important and must be equal to 2 powered to number of
        pixels per character. For example:<ul>
            <li>2 x 2 pixels per character - 16 characters.</li>
            <li>2 x 3 pixels per character - 64 characters.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Appearance settings</h2>

<p>The settings affect the appearance of interface:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>ColorNormal</strong> - Color of default
        background and foreground in all work modes.</li>
    <li><strong>ColorBeyondLine</strong> - Color of background
        indicating area beyond end of line, but not below the
        last line.</li>
    <li><strong>ColorBeyondEnd</strong> - Color of background
        indicatin area below the last line.</li>
    <li><strong>ColorCursor</strong> - Color of text cursor with
        guide lines in <strong>WorkMode=0</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>ColorStatus</strong> - Color of status bar in <strong>WorkMode=0</strong>
        and <strong>WorkMode=1</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>ColorPopup</strong> - Color of character selector
        and color selector in <strong>WorkMode=0</strong>, color
        of information window in <strong>WorkMode=2</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>BeyondLineColumn</strong> - Number of columns,
        which will be displayed using <strong>ColorNormal</strong>
        instead of <strong>ColorBeyondLine</strong> regardless
        being beyond of the text line. This setting may improve
        readibility of some ANSI files. If you use negative
        value, there will be used the same value as <strong>ANSIWidth</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Console settings</h2>

<p>Settings related to console, affects when <strong>WinUse=0</strong>
only.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>ConInputEncoding</strong> - Set encoding name or
        codepage for writing characters. Use it to solve problems
        in entering characters, especially diacritic characters
        using keyboard. Affects only when you use <strong>WinUse=0</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>ConOutputEncoding</strong> - Set encoding name or
        codepage for printing characters. Use it to solve
        problems in displaying characters. Affects only when you
        use <strong>WinUse=0</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>ConCursorDisplay</strong> - Display cursor
        character at cursor position. In most cases, the value
        should be <strong>CursorDisplay=1</strong>. Sometimes,
        the cursor can be invisible while moving due to inverting
        background and text colors in some console
        implementations. Use <strong>ConCursorDisplay=0</strong>
        to not draw cursor character and may help in cursor
        visibility.</li>
    <li><strong>ConUseMemo</strong> - Use additional text memory
        in console (not affects when <strong>WinUse=1</strong> or
        <strong>WinUse=2</strong>). The application uses the
        console buffer move from the system API while scrolling
        the text. You can set one of the following values:<ul>
            <li><strong>0</strong> - Use console buffer moving.
                This setting is recommended, while all characters
                are displayed correctly while text scrolling.</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> - Use console buffer moving
                with rewriting non-ASCII characters. Use this
                setting if some characters are displayed
                incorrectly during text scrolling although the
                same characters are displayed correctly during
                writing/painting using Textpaint functions. This
                may slightly slow down the text rendering during
                scrolling. </li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> - Do not use console buffer
                moving. Use this setting only if the text
                rendering crashes during trying to scroll. This
                setting causes, that every character on screen is
                rewritten during text scrolling.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Window settings</h2>

<p>Settings related to window, affects when <strong>WinUse=1</strong>
or <strong>WinUse=2</strong> only:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>WinCellW</strong> - Character cell width in
        window. If you use bitmap font, it will be rounded to
        integer multiply of font glyph width.</li>
    <li><strong>WinCellH</strong> - Character cell height in
        window. If you use bitmap font, it will be rounded to
        integer multiply of font glyph height.</li>
    <li><strong>WinFontName</strong> - Font name or bitmap file
        in window, the name can be interpreted by one of three
        ways from highest priority:<ul>
            <li><strong>File name</strong> - Use bitmap font
                file.</li>
            <li><strong>Generic font name</strong> - Use one of
                three generic font names, the actual font depends
                on operating system:<ul>
                    <li><strong>GenericSerif</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>GenericSansSerif</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>GenericMonospace</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Font name</strong> - Use selected font,
                like <strong>Arial</strong>, <strong>Courier</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>WinFontSize</strong> - Font size in window. This
        setting not affects the cell size.</li>
    <li><strong>WinW</strong> - Number of columns. To display
        whole status bar, it should be at least <strong>WinW=40</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>WinH</strong> - Number of rows.</li>
    <li><strong>WinFixed</strong> - Fided number of rows and
        columns regardless current window size.</li>
    <li><strong>WinSteadyCursor</strong> - Steady cursor display
        instead of blinking.</li>
    <li><strong>WinColorBlending</strong> - Enables color
        blending for some block characters. This parameter
        affects to this characters:<ul>
            <li><strong>2591h</strong>, <strong>2592h</strong>, <strong>2593h</strong>.</li>
            <li>From <strong>1FB8Ch</strong> to <strong>1FB94h</strong>.</li>
            <li>From <strong>1FB9Ch</strong> to <strong>1FB9Fh</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>WinPaletteR</strong> - The red component of all
        16 colors.</li>
    <li><strong>WinPaletteG</strong> - The green component of all
        16 colors.</li>
    <li><strong>WinPaletteB</strong> - The blue component of all
        16 colors.</li>
    <li><strong>WinPaletteFile</strong> - If provided, there is
        external file containing the palette. If the file does
        not exist or is unreadable, the parameter will be
        ignored. The structure of file are the same as <strong>Config.txt</strong>,
        but it contains only three parameters: <strong>WinPaletteR</strong>,
        <strong>WinPaletteG</strong>, <strong>WinPaletteB</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>WinColorBlending</strong> can be configured with
the <strong>WinColorBlending_X</strong> parameters, where <strong>X</strong>
means the number from 1. Every entry consists of 5 numbers:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Original character hexadecimal number.</li>
    <li>Replacement character hexadecimal number.</li>
    <li>Number of parts of background color.</li>
    <li>Number of parts of foreground color.</li>
    <li>Modified color type:<ul>
            <li><strong>0</strong> - Background.</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> - Foreground.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="1_09.gif" alt="`Readme/1_09.png" width="640"
height="384"></p>

<p>The <strong>WinPaletteR</strong>, <strong>WinPaletteG</strong>
and <strong>WinPaletteB</strong> defines the palette, which will
be used to display 16 colors in window. You can define arbitraty
colors. Each of the parameters must consist of 32 hexadecimal
digits. Each 2 digits defines value for one channer of single
color. Below, there are some examples.</p>

<p>DOS 16-color palette with dark yellow (default palette):</p>

<pre>WinPaletteR=00AA00AA00AA00AA55FF55FF55FF55FF
WinPaletteG=0000AAAA0000AAAA5555FFFF5555FFFF
WinPaletteB=00000000AAAAAAAA55555555FFFFFFFF</pre>

<p>DOS 16-color palette with brown instead of dark yellow:</p>

<pre>WinPaletteR=00AA00AA00AA00AA55FF55FF55FF55FF
WinPaletteG=0000AA550000AAAA5555FFFF5555FFFF
WinPaletteB=00000000AAAAAAAA55555555FFFFFFFF</pre>

<p>Windows VGA palette:</p>

<pre>WinPaletteR=00800080008000C080FF00FF00FF00FF
WinPaletteG=00008080000080C08000FFFF0000FFFF
WinPaletteB=00000000808080C080000000FFFFFFFF</pre>

<p>You can set the <strong>WinPaletteR</strong>, <strong>WinPaletteG</strong>
and <strong>WinPaletteB</strong> parameter in other text file and
you can provide the file name to <strong>WinPaletteFile</strong>
parameter. If there are both propertly defined <strong>WinPaletteFile</strong>
and <strong>WinPaletteR</strong>/<strong>WinPaletteG</strong>/<strong>WinPaletteB</strong>
parameters, the <strong>WinPaletteFile</strong> has higher
priority.</p>

<h2>Cipher settings</h2>

<p>Settings related to cipher are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>CipherMode</strong> - Chipher mode:<ul>
            <li><strong>0</strong> - No cipher.</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> - Cipher with repeated key.</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> - Cipher with autokey on plain
                text.</li>
            <li><strong>3</strong> - Cipher with autokey on
                ciphered text.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>CipherBegin</strong> - Character codes, which
        indicated begining of ciphered text. It must be at least
        code to enable cipher.</li>
    <li><strong>CipherEnd</strong> - Character codes, which
        indicated ending of ciphered text. It must be at least
        code to enable cipher.</li>
    <li><strong>CipherAlphabet</strong> - Full cipher alphabet
        provided as text. It should be consists of standard
        characters. Only characters existing in the alphabet can
        be ciphered and used i password. The character order is
        important.</li>
    <li><strong>CipherPassword</strong> - Password used instead
        of manually input at every save or every load file.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other settings</h2>

<p>The parameters described above are not the all available
parameters. The other parameters are related to ANSI interpreter
and work modes other than 0. These parameters are described in <strong>Readme_ANSI.md</strong>
file.</p>

<h2>Character encodings</h2>

<p>Console and files uses some encoding for input and output
charaters. You can input codepage or encoding name. If value
consists of digits only, it will be treated as codepage number,
otherwise, it will be threated as encoding name. If you not set
or set incorrect name, the system default encoding will be used.
The <strong>ConInputEncoding</strong> and <strong>ConOutputEncoding</strong>
are not the same as <strong>FileReadEncoding</strong> and <strong>FileWriteEncoding</strong>.</p>

<p>The most common encodings:</p>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td>Name</td>
        <td>Codepage</td>
        <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>us-ascii</td>
        <td>20127</td>
        <td>7-bit ASCII</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>utf-8</td>
        <td>65001</td>
        <td>Unicode - UTF-8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>utf-16</td>
        <td>1200</td>
        <td>Unicode - little endian</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>utf-16BE</td>
        <td>1201</td>
        <td>Unicode - big endian</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>You can set any encoding supported by .NET API function <font
face="Liberation Serif"><tt>System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding(Int32)</tt></font>
and <font face="Liberation Serif"><tt>System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding(String)</tt></font>,
details can be found on the web, list of all supported encoding
can be achieved on <strong>WorkMode=3</strong>. This settings
affects only console input/output.</p>

<h2>Encoding from file</h2>

<p>You can create custom 8-byte encoding, which encodes every
supported character as single byte. Many 8-bit encodings,
including 437, 1252 codepages, were popular before Unicode was
widespreaded. Such encoding assigns one character to every number
from 0 to 255 (byte value), the same character may be assigned to
several byte values.</p>

<p>The file has similar convention to <strong>Config.txt</strong>
file, so there are list of parameters with value for each
parameter. In encoding file, the parameter is the byte value
denoted as hexadecimal number and the value is denoted as
hexadecimal character number.</p>

<p>Lines, which does not contain the <strong>=</strong> character
and blank lines are ignored, so you can write comments and
additional information, which will not be processed. Other
parameters, such as <strong>Name</strong>, will also be ignored.</p>

<p>To use the file, you have to place file name with path in
place of the encoding name/codepage.</p>

<p>You can use the <strong>WorkMode=3</strong> to test encoding
file or display character list of system encodings. Details are
in <strong>Readme_keys.md</strong> file.</p>

<p>You can generate files from all system 8-bit encodings using <strong>WorkMode=4</strong>,
details are in <strong>Readme_render.md</strong> file.</p>

<h2>Frame elements</h2>

<p>The <strong>Frame1_x</strong> and <strong>Frame2_x</strong>
parameters defines the frame character set as comma separated
list. The first item is the name. From the second item to the
last item there are 11 hexadecimal character codes, which defines
the frame elements by following order (the numbers 1 and 2 are
line elements, the numbers from 3 to 11 are the corner and
junction elements):</p>

<pre>    -     1     \
    |     2     /

3---4---5       3
|   |   |      / \
|   |   |     6   4
|   |   |    / \ / \
6---7---8   9   7   5
|   |   |    \ / \ /
|   |   |    10   8
|   |   |      \ /
9--10--11      11</pre>

<p>As you can see, the diamond is treated as rectangle rorate by
45 degrees clockwise. Every <strong>Frame1_x</strong> and <strong>Frame2_x</strong>
must consist of 12 item including character set name. Application
reads the correctly defined numbers to the first incorrectly
defined or missing number.</p>

<h1>Text cipher</h1>

<p>TextPaint can cipher some fragments of text using Vigenere's
cipher using repeated key or autokey. If enabled, some fragments
of text file can be ciphered. Cipher setting defines characters,
which begins or ends the ciphered fragments. The remaining
contents will not be ciphered, so it makes to difficult to attack
the ciphered text, because the knowledge about text information
and text layout is useless to guess the used password. To achieve
most security, you should meeet the conditions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Text to be ciphered is a random character sequence, for
        example randomly-generated passwords.</li>
    <li>Cipher key is random character sequence.</li>
    <li>Every character in text to be cipher and cipher key
        exists in cipher alphabet.</li>
    <li>Cipher key is longer than whole text to be ciphered.</li>
    <li>One key is used to cipher one file.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can enable or disable cipher in <strong>Config.txt</strong>
setting <strong>CipherMode</strong>, using one of following
values:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>0</strong> - No cipher.</li>
    <li><strong>1</strong> - Cipher with repeated key.</li>
    <li><strong>2</strong> - Cipher with autokey on plain text.</li>
    <li><strong>3</strong> - Cipher with autokey on ciphered
        text.</li>
</ul>

<p>If value is <strong>0</strong>, the cipher will be disabled
regardless other settings related with cipher. To enable cipher,
you can also set to non-blank values the following settings:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>CipherBegin</strong></li>
    <li><strong>CipherEnd</strong></li>
    <li><strong>CipherAlphabet</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>CipherBegin</strong> and <strong>CipherEnd</strong>
defines the characters, which can begin or end the text. For
example, assume, that <strong>CipherBegin=005B,007B</strong> and <strong>CipherEnd=005D,007D</strong>.
In this case, if whole text is <font face="Liberation Serif"><tt>abcde[fghij]klmno{pqrst}uvwxy</tt></font>,
only the <font face="Liberation Serif"><tt>fghij</tt></font> and <font
face="Liberation Serif"><tt>pqrst</tt></font> will be ciphered,
the remaining fragments will be plain.</p>

<p>The <strong>CipherAlphabet</strong> defines whole set of the
characters, which must exists in text to be ciphered. The
Vigenere cipher alhorithm bases on alphabet and assigns number
for every character in the alphabet. For example, the <strong>CipherAlphabet</strong>
value can be a sequence of small or capital letters ordered
alphabetically. Consider the two cases:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>CipherAlphabet=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</strong></li>
    <li><strong>CipherAlphabet=qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The two values are not the same, because different numbers
will be assigned for the same characters. If <strong>CipherAlphabet</strong>
will blank, the cipher will be disabled. The characters defined
as <strong>CipherBegin</strong> and <strong>CipherEnd</strong>
must not exists in cipher alphabet.</p>

<h2>Using cipher</h2>

<p>If cipher is enabled and meets all required conditions,
everytime, if you open or reload file, you will be asked for the
password. The password will be used to decipher text. If you
provide blank password (just pressing <strong>Enter</strong>
without inputting any characters), the text will be loaded as is,
without deciphering. If you input wrong password, the text will
be deciphered incorrectly.</p>

<p>If you provide wrong password, you can retry by pressing <strong>F8</strong>
key (reload file) and input password again.</p>

<p>When you save file by pressing <strong>F7</strong> key, you
will be also asket for password and you have to input the
password twice. If the first and second password are not the
same, you will be again asked for password. To save file without
ciphering, just press <strong>Enter</strong> key twice without
inputting any characters. At the moment, you can change the
password by inputting new password, which differs from the
password used to load file.</p>

<p>If you input password containing characters, which not exist
in cipher alphabet, these characters will be ignored. From this
rule, there is one exception, described in <strong>Password from
file</strong> subchapter.</p>

<h2>Password from file</h2>

<p>You can use file instead of password to input very long
password. To do this, you have to input password according the
rules:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The first character is the chipher begin character.</li>
    <li>The last character is the chipher end character.</li>
    <li>The string between the first and the last character is
        the filename.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples assuming that <strong>CipherBegin=005B</strong>, <strong>CipherEnd=005D</strong>
and <strong>CipherAlphabet=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</strong>:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>pass123</strong> - The password is <strong>pass</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>[pas2s</strong> - The password is <strong>pass</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>3pass]</strong> - The password is <strong>pass</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>[pass123.txt]</strong> - The password is from
        file <strong>pass123.txt</strong> existing in the current
        directory.</li>
    <li><strong>[C:\Documents\pass.123.txt]</strong> - The
        password is from file <strong>pass123.txt</strong>
        existing in the <strong>C:\Documents\</strong> directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>The file contents will be read as text file and the text will
be used as password.</p>

<h2>Several password for one file</h2>

<p>You can cipher some text fragment using the first password and
the another text fragment within the same file using the second
password, which differs from the first password. To get such
effects, you have to do following steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open file.</li>
    <li>Input all fragments of text to be ciphered.</li>
    <li>Save file using the first password.</li>
    <li>Reload file using the second password.</li>
    <li>Reinput the information to be ciphered using the second
        password.</li>
    <li>Save the file using the second password.</li>
</ol>

<p>At the time, if you load file using the first password, the
first information will be shown as plain text and the second
information will be unreadable. If you open the file using the
second password, the first information will be unreadable and the
second information will be shown as plain text.</p>

<p>There is sample file read without password:</p>

<p><img src="1_11.gif" alt="`Readme/1_11.png" width="640"
height="384"></p>

<p>The same file read with password &quot;QwE34RtY&quot;:</p>

<p><img src="1_12.gif" alt="`Readme/1_12.png" width="640"
height="384"></p>

<p>The same file read with password &quot;z1X23C4v&quot;:</p>

<p><img src="1_13.gif" alt="`Readme/1_13.png" width="640"
height="384"></p>

<h1>Bitmap fonts</h1>

<p>The <strong>TextPaint</strong> application supports the bitmap
fonts in windows mode. Such font is saved as bitmap file, which
is provided as <strong>WinFontName</strong> parameter in <strong>Config.txt</strong>
file. Using bitmap fonts instead of system font or console mode,
has following advantages:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use any custom characters in unicode range.</li>
    <li>Such font is truely fixed-width.</li>
    <li>Achieve old-school look, for example like DOS or some
        8-bit computers with screen.</li>
    <li>Modifying glyphs are easy, just edit bitmap in favorite
        image editor.</li>
    <li>Avoid breaking and overlaying semigraphical glyphs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using bitmap fonts has also disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The cell width and height must be integer multiply of
        glyph width and height.</li>
    <li>When you use large font file (with many pages), opening
        application may take a while.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bitmap font format</h2>

<p>The bitmap font is organized in pages, single page consists of
256 characters. Every page has number from 0 to 255, but unicode
defines 17 planes from 0 to 16, so in fact, the page number are
from 0 to 4351. Bitmap can use any color mode, but the color will
be thresholded into two colors, black and white, so every pixel
will be readed as black or white, depending on pixel brightness.</p>

<p>The bitmap width determines the font glyph and must match the
formula <font face="Liberation Serif"><tt>(W * 256) + 16)</tt></font>,
where <strong>W</strong> is the glyph width. For example, for
width 8 pixels, the bitmap must have 2064 pixels width. The glyph
height is determined by bitmap height. The bitmap height is
simply glyph height multiplied by number of pages defined in the
bitmap. The number of defined pages may vary depending on glyphs,
which will be defined.</p>

<p>Every row consists of binary encoded page number and glyph
images of this page. The page number code occupies 16 pixels from
left and is a binary code, when black means 0 and white means 1.
The code height must be the same as glyph height. On the glyphs
part, the black (dark) color means 0 (background) and the white
(bright) color means 1 (foreground).</p>

<p>The page order int he bitmap is not important.</p>

<h2>Supplied fonts</h2>

<p>The <strong>TextPaint</strong> supplies example bitmap fonts
in <strong>Fonts</strong> subfolder, which can be used. In the
bitmaps, there was applied the following color convention:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>White on black</strong> - Original glyphs
        existing in source.</li>
    <li><strong>Yellow on blue</strong> - Painted or corrected
        glyphs.</li>
    <li><strong>Green on purple</strong> - Original glyphs
        existing in source, but the glyph placement was changed
        to fix errors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some fonts has glyph size 16x16, but these fonts has also
08x16 version. Glyphs existing in 08x16 version are the same as
in the 16x16 version. In the 16x16 version there are more glyphs,
which are not exist in 08x16 version.</p>

<p>The example fonts are generated based on three sources,
disinguished by font file name prefix:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Dos</strong> - <a
        href="https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/fontlist/">https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/fontlist/</a>
        - Standard EGA and VGA fonts, which looks like a standard
        DOS font. There are added some additional glyphs:<ul>
            <li><strong>Page 25</strong> - Border heavy variant,
                quadrant boxes, four triangle glyphs from <strong>25E2h</strong>
                to <strong>25E5h</strong>. The glyphs <strong>2580h</strong>,
                <strong>2581h</strong> and <strong>2584h</strong>
                are slightly corrected in some variants.</li>
            <li><strong>Page 28</strong> - Braille dots.</li>
            <li><strong>Page 1FB</strong> - Semigraphical shapes
                from <strong>1FB00h</strong> to <strong>1FBAFh</strong>,
                including <strong>1FB93h</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Unscii</strong> - <a
        href="http://viznut.fi/unscii/">http://viznut.fi/unscii/</a>
        - All fonts from Unscii project, without any modyfication
        and additional glyphs but correction of <strong>2509h</strong>
        glyph in all 8x8 versions. This fonts contains
        non-standard characters, some glyph placement (page <strong>25h</strong>
        and <strong>1FBh</strong>) are manually corrected,
        because some glyph positions was swapped related to
        unicode standard.</li>
    <li><strong>Unifont</strong> - <a
        href="https://unifoundry.com/unifont/">https://unifoundry.com/unifont/</a>
        - Two versions of Unifont with manually added <strong>1FB93h</strong>
        glyph. This font provides the most unicode coverage. In
        both fonts, the 08x16 glyphs are exactly the same, so
        there exists single 08x16 Unifont variant.</li>
    <li><strong>Small</strong> - <a
        href="https://opengameart.org/content/4x4-px-bitmap-font">https://opengameart.org/content/4x4-px-bitmap-font</a>
        - Small font, which is manually extended with many
        semigraphical glyphs and can be used to view large
        ASCII/ANSI arts. The readibility of letters and digits is
        poor due to small character size.</li>
    <li><strong>Amiga</strong> - <a
        href="https://github.com/rewtnull/amigafonts">https://github.com/rewtnull/amigafonts</a>
        - Fonts suitable for some ASCII-art or ANSI-art files,
        which was created on Amiga computers.</li>
    <li><strong>VT</strong> - <a
        href="https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/2019/dec-crt-typography">https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/2019/dec-crt-typography</a>
        - The font, which is used in real DEC VT220 terminal,
        extended with some semigraphical glyphs.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Other supplied files</h1>

<p>In the TextPaint filder, there are included some other files
than bitmap fonts, which can help to use this software,
especially the editor (<strong>WorkMode=0</strong>).</p>

<h2>Encodings</h2>

<p>TextPaint can use custom 1-byte encoding. In the Encodings
subfolder, there are 4 files. The following 2 files are suitable
for opening ANSI/ASCII files and has control character mapped as
are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>ASCII.txt</strong> - The base ASCII-compatible
        encoding, where the character number equals to byte
        balue. You can create copy of the file and use it to
        create own encoding. The encoding is the same as
        ISO-8859-1.</li>
    <li><strong>DOS437.txt</strong> - The slightly modified
        standard DOS code page 437. The modification are changing
        few characters to match to <strong>Dos</strong> font. The
        ambiguous characters are listed an the end of the file
        (lines without <strong>=</strong> sign are ignored). The
        file or standard 437 code page should be used to open
        most old ANSI and ASCII files.</li>
    <li><strong>VT220.txt</strong> - Encoding very similar to
        ASCII (only few characters changed), intended to view
        original VT100 files from <a
        href="http://artscene.textfiles.com/vt100/">http://artscene.textfiles.com/vt100/</a>,
        which uses 8-bit characters supported on VT220 terminal
        and successors.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are another 2 encodings, which are designed for
converting BIN or XBIN file to ANSI file. The only difference are
in assignment to values from <strong>00h</strong> to <strong>1Fh</strong>:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>BIN_ASCII.txt</strong> - Encoding based on <strong>ASCII.txt</strong>,
        the control characters are remaped to from <strong>2400h</strong>
        to <strong>241Fh</strong>, the characters are printable
        equivalents to control characters.</li>
    <li><strong>BIN_DOS437.txt</strong> - Encoding based on <strong>DOS437.txt</strong>,
        the control characters are mapped to standard DOS glyphs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Palettes</h2>

<p>In the <strong>Palettes</strong> subfolder, there are three
example palette files, which can be used to parameter <strong>WinPaletteFile</strong>:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>DOS.txt</strong> - Standard DOS palette without
        exception.</li>
    <li><strong>DOSBrown.txt</strong> - Standard DOS palette with
        exception, that there is brown color instead of dark
        yellow.</li>
    <li><strong>WinVGA.txt</strong> - Standard Windows 16-color
        VGA palette.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Samples</h2>

<p>There are samples for demonstration and test purposes in <strong>WorkMode=0</strong>.
Files other than <strong>8bitASCII.txt </strong>are encoded using
UTF-8.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>8bitASCII.txt</strong> - Standard 8-bit ASCII
        file, which should be opened using 1-byte encoding. You
        can test 1-byte encoding matches and display all
        available character in such encoding. There is only file,
        which is in ANSCII encoding.</li>
    <li><strong>Borders.txt</strong> - Demonstrates border and
        block characters.</li>
    <li><strong>Cipher.txt</strong> - Demonstrates text
        chiphering. To use this file, you chould open using
        following parameters:<ul>
            <li><strong>CipherMode=0</strong></li>
            <li><strong>CipherAlphabet=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789</strong></li>
            <li><strong>CipherBegin=005B</strong></li>
            <li><strong>CipherEnd=005D</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Math.txt</strong> - Demonstrates the Unicode
        alphabets used in mathemating notation.</li>
    <li><strong>Unscii.txt</strong> - Demonstration art for
        Unscii font. There is corrected art based on <a
        href="http://viznut.fi/unscii/">http://viznut.fi/unscii/</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>FontSize.ans</strong> - Various font sizes.</li>
    <li><strong>ColorWheel.ans</strong> - Demonstration of all 16
        colors, uses Unicode characters.</li>
    <li><strong>ColorBlend.ans</strong> - Color blending
        demonstration.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also samples, which are not created with <strong>TextPaint</strong>,
but can be loaded into <strong>TextPaint</strong> or other
terminal emulator:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Colors16.ans</strong> - Two ways to use all 16
        standard colors. If bold and blink is not ignored, <strong>TextPaint</strong>
        shows the same result in both ways.</li>
    <li><strong>Colors256.ans</strong> - The 256-color palette, <strong>TextPaint</strong>
        can read 256-color codes, but converts such colors into
        standard 16 colors.</li>
    <li><strong>TextFormat.ans</strong> - Test of all VT100 text
        format flags (bold, blink, negative, underline). <strong>TextPaint</strong>
        ignores underline flag, but the file can be used for test
        other terminals.</li>
